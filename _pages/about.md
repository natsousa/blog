<p style="text-align: center;"> Hey You! </p>
I am happy you found me. It is a pleasure to share with you what I have been doing so far.
<br/>
So, here we go. I spent ten years studying plants-microorganism and soil ecology, this was my academic path.
Although I am a biologist, recently I discovered a passion for programming and data analyses.
I have experienced programming, statistics and trial design during university and this opened my mind to dive deeper in the data world.
Then I decided to change careers to a more data-focused role, thereby I landed as a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalia-sousa-95401183/">data manager for research and development corporation</a>.
It is a way I found to ensure data usage to outline meaningful insights... Well, later I explain in details how did this change happen. ðŸ˜Š

<small>My writings</small>

Here dear follows, I would like to bring some more digestible programming and analysis information for non-tech buddies.
My mission is to explain to you in the way I would like people have explained to me how tech runs, to make my learning path smoother.
Then I have the vision to your life a bit easier, please let me know otherwise. Here is also an open channel for feedback and collaborations.
By the way, I love collaboration.

Plus...
<br/>
Besides that, I like to share a bit from personal interest apart from professional and contribute to people's general understanding of the world.
It involves topics (but not just) like:
<br/>
* Plants, herbs.
* Culture, music.
* Food.
* whatever thoughts...
