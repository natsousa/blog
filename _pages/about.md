<p style="text-align: center;"> Hey You! </p>
I am happy you found me. It is a pleasure to share with you what I did so far, and the paths I am taking.
<br/>
Well, In my several years in academia I studied plants-microorganism and soil ecology.
Although I am a biologist, recently I discovered a passion for programming and data analytics.
I have experienced programming (bioinformatics) and statistics during university, which opened my mind to dive deeper in the data world.
Then I decided to change careers to a more data-focused role, thereby I landed as a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalia-sousa-95401183/">data manager for research and development industry</a>.
It was a way I found to learn and ensure data usage for outlining meaningful insights... Well, later I can explain better how this change happened. ðŸ˜Š

Here dear follows, I would like to bring some more digestible programming and analysis information for non-tech buddies.
My mission is to explain you in a way I would like people have explained to me how tech runs, to make learning path smoother.
Then I have the vision to make life a bit easier, please let me know otherwise.
Here is also an open channel for feedbacks and collaborations.
By the way, I love collaboration.
